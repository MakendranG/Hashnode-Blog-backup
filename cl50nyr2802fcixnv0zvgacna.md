## Web Security Considerations

`Web security` refers to  the security of data on the Internet/network or the web or during data transmission over the Internet. 

For example., When you transfer data between client and server and you need to protect that data, data security is your web security.

## Web Security threats

A `threat` is nothing more than a possible event that can damage and harm an information system. A security threat is defined as a risk that  can  harm a computer system and an organization. Whenever an individual or organization creates a website, it is very vulnerable to security attacks. 

Security attacks are mainly aimed at stealing, altering or destroying  personal and confidential information, stealing disk space, illegally accessing passwords. 

## Security Considerations

### Software Update

You should keep your software up to date. Hackers may be aware of vulnerabilities in certain software, which are sometimes buggy and can be used to damage your computer system and steal personal data. 

`Older software versions`  can become a gateway for hackers to gain access to your network. Software manufacturers are quick to become aware of these vulnerabilities and patch vulnerable or exposed areas. This is why it's imperative to keep your software up to date. It plays an important role in the security of your personal data. 

### Beware of SQL injection 

`SQL injection` is an attempt to manipulate your data or  database by inserting raw code into your query. 

For example., Someone can send a request to your site and this request can be an approximation of code while it is running it can be used to manipulate your database like modifying tables, editing change  or delete data or it can also retrieve important information, be aware of  SQL injection attacks.



### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS allows  attackers to insert client-side scripts into web pages. 

For example., Submission of forms. It is a term used to describe an attack class  that allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into another user's browser through a web page. When the code is injected into the browser from the website, the code is trusted and can do things like send the user's website authorization cookie to the attacker.  

### Error Messages

You must be very careful about the error messages  generated to provide information to the user when the user visits the site and some error messages are generated for one reason or another  and You must be very careful when providing  information to  users. 

For example., Login attempt - If the user is unable to login, the error message will not tell the user  which field is incorrect: username or password. 

### Data validation

Data validation is the proper checking of any input provided by the user or application. It prevents incorrectly generated data from entering  information systems. 

Data validation should be done on both `server side and client side`. If we do data validation on both sides, it will give us  authentication. Data validation must take place when data is received from a third party, especially if the data comes from `unreliable sources`. 

### Passwords

Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your device and personal information. It is necessary to use a `strong password`. In many cases, hackers use sophisticated software that uses `brute force to crack passwords`. 

Passwords must be complex to protect from brute force. It is good practice to enforce password requirements, such as a minimum of eight characters, including uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.

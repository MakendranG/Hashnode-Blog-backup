Software developers are creative power behind all types of computer programs. They design and write the code used to create anything from operating systems to applications to video games.

In this role, you may be involved in all stages of the software development process, from understanding what users need and how to use the software, to deploying the finished application. Many developers do all the coding themselves, but sometimes they work with computer programmers.

Daily activities include:

1. Analyze software user needs
2. Design, test and build software that meets user needs
3. Create templates and diagrams that describe the code needed to create programs and applications
4. Perform maintenance and testing to keep programs running
5. Document the processes to provide the information needed for updates and maintenance

## Software developer vs. Software Engineer: What's the Difference?

> Software developers and engineers perform many of the same functions with many of the same skills. The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, there is usually a slight difference between the two roles. Software developers typically work on a smaller scale than engineers and often focus on areas such as mobile applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Software engineers, on the other hand, make a big picture that includes data analysis, testing, and measurement, not just programming.

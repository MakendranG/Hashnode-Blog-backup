## Benefits and working of DevSecOps

## Benefits of DevSecOps 

The two main benefits of DevSecOps are `security and speed`. The development team is offering better, more secure code faster and therefore cheaper. 

## Fast and affordable software delivery 

- If the software is developed in an environment other than DevSecOps, security issues can cause significant `time delays`. 
- Fixing  code and security issues can be time consuming and costly. Deploying DevSecOps quickly and securely `saves time and money` by minimizing the need to repeat the process of fixing security issues after the fact.  
- This is more efficient and cost effective because the built-in security eliminates double checks and unnecessary rebuilds, making your `code more secure`. 

## Improved proactive security 

- DevSecOps has implemented a `cybersecurity process` from the beginning of the development cycle. 
- Throughout the development cycle, your code is reviewed, audited, scanned, and tested for security issues. These issues will be addressed as soon as they are identified. 
- Address security issues before additional dependencies are introduced. 
- Identifying and implementing protection technologies early in the cycle makes it more `cost-effective` to fix security issues. 
- In addition, better collaboration between development, security, and operations teams improves the organization's response in the event of an incident or problem. 
- DevSecOps practices reduce the time it takes to patch vulnerabilities and free your security team to focus on more important tasks. 
- These practices also ensure and simplify regulatory compliance and save application development projects from the need to retrofit security measures. 

## Accelerating patching of vulnerabilities 

The main advantage of DevSecOps is the ability to quickly manage newly identified  vulnerabilities.  

DevSecOps integrates vulnerability scanning and patching into the release cycle, reducing the ability to identify and `patch Common Vulnerability and Exposures`. 

This limits the windows at which attackers must exploit the publicly faced production system vulnerabilities. 

## Automation compatible with the latest development 

- If your company ships software using a continuous integration / continuous delivery pipeline, you can integrate cybersecurity testing  into an automated test suite for your operations team. 
- Security management automation is highly dependent on  project and organizational goals. 
- Automated testing ensures that your embedded software dependencies are at the appropriate patch level and  that your software passes security tests. 
- You can also use static and dynamic analytics to test and protect your code before pushing the final updates to production. 

## Reproducible and adaptive process 

- As your organization matures, so does your attitude toward security. 
- DevSecOps is suitable for repeatable and adaptive processes. This ensures that security is `consistently applied` throughout the environment as the environment changes and adapts to new requirements. 
- Mature implementations of DevSecOps include robust automation, configuration management, orchestration, containers, immutable infrastructure, and even serverless computing environments.

## How does DevSecOps work?

Improves automation across the software delivery pipeline, eliminates errors, and reduces attacks and downtime. 

For teams looking to integrate security into the DevOps framework, the process can be completed seamlessly with the appropriate DevSecOps tools and processes. 
 
Let's have a look at a general DevSecOps and DevOps workflow.
 

1. Developers write code within a version control  system. 
2. Changes are transferred to the version control  system.  
3. Another developer gets the code from a version control  system and performs static code analysis to identify  security flaws and code quality errors. 
4. Then use an Infrastructure-as-Code tool such as Chef to create your environment. 
5. The application is deployed and then the security configuration is applied to the system. 
6. Then run the test automation suite on your newly deployed application, including backends, UIs, integrations, security tests, APIs, and more. 
7. If your application passes these tests, it will be deployed to your production environment.  
8. This new production environment is continuously monitored  to identify  active security threats to the system.  

With a test-driven development environment  and automated testing, and continuous integration as part of your workflow, enterprises can  seamlessly and quickly work towards the common goals of higher code quality and improved security and compliance.

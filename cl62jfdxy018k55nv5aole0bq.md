## DevSecOps best practices

`DevSecOps` needs to naturally integrate security controls into the development, deployment, and operational processes. Kindly find below mentioned are the DevSecOps best practices. 

- Shift Left Approach
- Security education 
- Culture
- Traceability, auditability,  visibility 

Let us deep dive in detail now.


## Shift Left Approach

- "Shift Left" is the DevSecOps mantra. This encourages software developers to shift security from  right to  left in the DevOps process. 
- In the DevSecOps environment, `security` is an integral part of the development process from the beginning. 
- Organizations using DevSecOps invite `cyber security architects` and engineers as part of their development team. 
- Your job is to ensure that all components and  configuration items in the stack are `patched, securely configured, and documented`. 
- Shifting to the left allows the DevSecOps team to identify security risks and `vulnerabilities` early and respond immediately to these security threats. 
- The development team not only thinks about developing the product efficiently, but  also implements `security during development`. 

## Security education 

- Security is a combination of `engineering and compliance`. 
- Organizations need to form `partnerships` between  development engineers, operations teams, and compliance teams to ensure that everyone in the organization understands the organization's security structure and follows the same standards. 
- Anyone involved in the deployment process should be familiar with the basic principles of application security, the `Top 10 Open Web Application Security Projects` (OWASP), application security testing, and other security engineering practices. 
- Developers need to understand `threading models`, compliance checks, and have a working knowledge of risks and how risks are measured and  security controls are implemented. 

## Culture

### Communication, People, Processes and technologies 

- `Good leadership` fosters a good culture that drives change within an organization. 
- At DevSecOps, it is important and essential  to communicate responsibility for process security  and product ownership. 
- Only then can developers and engineers become process owners and take ownership for their work. 
- The DevSecOps operations team needs to build a system that works for them, using  technologies and protocols that are appropriate for the team and the project at hand. 
- By allowing the team to create a work environment that suits their needs, the team becomes a stakeholder interested in the outcome of the project. 

## Traceability, auditability,  visibility 

Implementing traceability, auditability, and visibility into your DevSecOps process leads to deeper insights and a safer environment. 

**Traceability** allows you to track configuration items throughout the development cycle to where the requirements are implemented in your code. 

It can play an important role in your organization's `control framework` as it helps you achieve compliance, reduce errors, ensure secure code in application development, and support code maintainability.  

**Auditability** is important to ensure compliance with security controls. 

Technical, procedural, and administrative security controls must be auditable, well documented, and adhered to by all team members.  

**Visibility** is generally a good management technique, but it is very important in a DevSecOps environment. 

This means organizations have a robust monitoring system  to measure `operational heartbeats, send alerts, raise awareness` when changes or cyberattacks  occur, and be accountable throughout the  project lifecycle.

## What is the main technology stack for web development today?

## MEAN stack 

MEAN may be considered the most ideal technology stack for web development. MEAN stands for (`MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS,  Node.js`). For end-to-end JavaScript stacks, the stack uses a single language. 

As a result, the code can be `reused throughout the  program`, reducing the need for unnecessary reinvention. Another advantage of using MEAN is that all  technologies are free and open source and are supported by a thriving community. 

The MEAN stack app is `versatile, scalable and extensible`, making it ideal for cloud hosting. The stack  comes with its own web server, so it's easy to set up. The database can be adjusted up or down as needed to accommodate temporary spikes in usage. 

With MEAN, you can work with a single team of JavaScript developers who can adapt to changing circumstances. MEAN is not suitable for all applications, but it excels in areas such as `calendars, mapping and location detection, and news aggregation`. 

### Benefits 

- UI rendering and performance. 
- Efficient cost. 
- Open Source. 
- Easily switch between  client and  server
 
### Disadvantages .

- Not suitable for large area applications. 
- Productivity is low. 

## MEVN stack 

As a `front-end framework`,  this version of MEAN is here instead of AngularVue.js. In recent years, this paradigm has received a lot of attention. This is a lighter solution than Angular. 

Vue.js has some basic functionality. You can extend this functionality using third-party services. `Vue.js` combines the best of Angular and React to provide excellent performance and a rich toolset. 

## LAMP stack 

The LAMP technology stack (`Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP`) is a proven combination of technologies. LAMP was still one of the most `popular technology stacks` in web development and  one of the first open source software stacks to be widely adopted. 

LAMP is used in popular open source CMS such as `WordPress and Drupal`. LAMP is known and recognized as ideal for developing custom solutions due to its reliability and simplicity. 

The LAMP stack can handle `dynamic pages` with content that changes each time the page is loaded.  LAMP is open source and not proprietary, so you can choose components that meet your unique business needs. Instead of using Linux as the operating system, you can use Microsoft Windows or MACOS to create a WAMP stack or  MAMP stack. Alternatively, you can use Perl or the increasingly popular Python language  instead of PHP.

### Benefits 

- Dynamic. 
- Completely open source. 
- reliability. 
- Digital document processing efficiency 

### Disadvantages 

-  Performance issues on busy websites 
-  Component integration 


## Serverless stack 

The best opportunity to evolve or become serverless in cloud infrastructure. Here, the service tools are provided by the computing platform. This feature has `streamlined infrastructure management`. 

Many web developers are switching to this new technology stack to make back-end work easier. 

### Benefits 

- Low cost. 
- There is less worry. 
- Interactive user experience 
- Scalability has been improved.  

### Disadvantages 

- Not suitable for long-term tasks. 
- complicated. 
- Vendor retention. 
- cold start.
 

## Flutter for the web 

Flutter for Web is a  cross-platform programming game changer. The user interface and business logic are the same on all platforms. With Flutter, you don't have to waste time deploying. You can troubleshoot, add new features, and create user interfaces without impacting performance. 

### Advantages

- darts
- High performance.  
- Growing popularity.  
- Save  money and time. 
- A slight learning curve.  
- UI theme. 
- A strong community.  

### Disadvantages 

- Limited set of tools and libraries. 
- Large file size. 
- IOS support will be reduced. 
- Password management is a bit tedious. 
 

## Metro.js stack 

Many people appreciate `Meteor.js` because the platform allows them to develop JavaScript apps quickly. It supports most of the popular and widely used tools and techniques that will make your job easier. If you're writing apps for different platforms, you don't need to change the code here. 

Meteor.js provides an `integrated JavaScript technology` stack that spans the viewer's screen from the application's database. If you want to build a scalable app, we recommend Meteor.js as the best option. This feature is  used by developers around the world. 



### Benefits 

-  Simplicity.  
- The client / server connection is seamless. 
-  tool for real-time testing. 
- debug. 
- Numerous packages and libraries are available.  

### Disadvantages 

-   SSR is not supported. 
- Data integrity 
-  Lack of its own widget collection. 
- PWA is not supported by default.

## DevOps & AWS



These services simplify infrastructure provisioning and management, deploy application code, automate the software release process, and monitor the performance of your applications and infrastructure. 


**DevOps** is a combination of  philosophies, practices, and cultural tools that increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high speed: develop and improve products at a faster rate than ever before with organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed allows organizations to better serve their customers and be more competitive in the marketplace. 

## Why use AWS for DevOps?


### Quick start 

Any AWS service is perfect if you have an AWS account. There are no system or software requirements to install.  

### Fully managed service 

These services can help you leverage AWS resources faster. You can worry less about configuring, installing, and operating the infrastructure yourself. This allows you to focus on your main product. 

### Built for scale 

You can manage a single instance or scale to thousands with AWS services. These services help you get the most out of flexible computing resources by simplifying licensing, configuration, and scaling.  

### Programmable 

You have the option of using each service through the AWS CLI or through the API and SDK. You can also model and provision your AWS resources and your entire AWS infrastructure using  AWS CloudFormation declarative templates.  

### Automation 

AWS helps you use automation so you can build faster and more efficiently. Using AWS services, you can automate manual tasks or processes such as deployment, development and testing workflows, container management, and configuration management. 


### Privacy 

Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define user permissions and policies. This gives you granular control over who can access your resources and how they access them. 

### Large ecosystem of partners 


AWS supports a large ecosystem of partners that integrate  and extend AWS services. Use your favorite third-party and open source tools with AWS to build  end-to-end solutions.  

### How much do pay that much 

With AWS, buy the services  you need  and only for the time you plan to use them. AWS Pricing has no upfront fees, termination penalties, or long-term contracts. The AWS Free Tier helps you get started with AWS. Visit each service's pricing page to learn more.

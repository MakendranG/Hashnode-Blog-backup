Of course, the interview did not have the hoped-for success, but you're not entirely wrong! Also, think about what you did right so you can be successful again in your next interview. 

Don't be discouraged after failing a job interview! Think of it as a learning experience. The situation is still there for you and you are now ready for the interview when it happens.

## What is machine learning?



Machine learning is an important part of the growing field of data science. Using statistical methods, algorithms are trained to classify or predict, revealing key ideas for data mining projects. This information then guides decisions in your app and business, ideally influencing key growth metrics. As big data continues to grow and grow, so will the market demand for data scientists. 

They are asked to help identify the most relevant business questions and data to answer. Machine learning algorithms are typically built using frameworks such as **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** that accelerate solution development.

## How does machine learning work?

The [University of California, Berkeley](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/blog/what-is-machine-learning/) divides its learning system of machine learning algorithms into three main parts. 

### Decision Making

- Generally, machine learning algorithms are used to make predictions or classifications. 
- Based on tagged or unnamed input data, the algorithms generate model estimates in the data.

### Error function

- The error function evaluates model predictions. 
- Given a well-known example, the error function can perform comparisons to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

### Model Optimization Process 

- As the model fits better to the data points in the training set, weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between known examples and model estimates. 
- The algorithm repeats this evaluation and optimization process, updating the weights individually until the accuracy limit is reached.

## Machine learning method

Machine learning models fall into three basic categories.

### Supervised machine learning   

Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined using labeled datasets to train algorithms to accurately classify data or predict outcomes. As input data is entered into the model, the model adjusts the weights until it fits properly. This is done as part of the cross-validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or undertreatment. 

Supervised learning helps organizations `solve a variety of real-world problems` on a large scale, such as sorting spam to a separate folder from the inbox. Techniques used in supervised learning include neural networks, naive cells, linear regression, logistic regression and random forests.

### Unsupervised machine learning

Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and aggregate unlabeled datasets. These algorithms detect **hidden patterns and data sets** without human intervention. This method is ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition, as it can detect similarities and differences in information. 

It is also used to reduce the number of features in the model through the dimensionality reduction process. `Principal Component Analysis` and `Single Value Analysis` are two popular approaches for this purpose. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-mean clustering, and probabilistic clustering techniques. 

### Semi-supervised learning

Semi-supervised learning offers a good middle ground between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, we use a small labeled dataset to guide classification and extract functionality from a large unlabeled dataset. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of lack of sufficiently labeled data for supervised learning algorithms. It is also useful when classifying enough data is too expensive. 

## Reinforcement machine learning

Advanced machine learning is a machine learning model similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm is not trained on data samples. This model learns by trial and error. Successful outcome chains are enriched to develop optimal recommendations or policies for specific problems. 

## Popular machine learning algorithms

Many machine learning algorithms are commonly used. Among which:

### Neural networks 

- Neural networks mimic the functioning of the human brain and have many associated processing nodes. 
- Neural networks excel in pattern recognition and play an important role in applications such as natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.

### Linear Regression

This algorithm is used to predict scalar values ​​based on linear relationships between different values. For example, this technique can be used to predict house prices based on a region's historical data. 

### Logistic Regression 

This guided learning algorithm expects categorical response variables, such as yes / no answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as spam classification and online quality control.

### Clustering 

Using unsupervised learning, cluster algorithms identify patterns in the data so they can be aggregated. Computers can help data scientists by identifying the differences in data that people have overlooked. 

### Decision trees 

- Decision trees can be used to predict numerical values and rank data. 
- A decision tree uses a branched series of related decisions that can be represented in a tree diagram. 
- An advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to validate and evaluate, unlike black boxes in neural networks.

### Random Forest


In a random forest, a machine learning algorithm combines the results of many decision trees to predict a value or class.

AWS OpsWorks lets you automate tasks by customizing individual parts of your application using Chef or Puppet-managed instances. The building blocks of AWS OpsWorks are **stacks**. Stacks allow you to model your application in multiple layers. 

# Typical Application server stack

In typical applications, these can be represented as web, application, and database tiers.

AWS OpsWorks lets you provision EC2 instances at any level and configures them with Chef to automate repetitive tasks like software installation and configuration. 

You can achieve these benefits by using the AWS OpsWorks cookbooks created by AWS. This cookbook is open source and you can create your own cookbook or assemble it to suit your application requirements.

## What is web application security and why is it important

`Web application security` is a concern stemming from  changing business standards that have pushed people to adopt the work-from-home framework due to the ongoing pandemic. This blog will identify  critical issues related to application security and what  organizations will need to overcome this threat. 

Web Application Security includes a multitude of techniques and strategies for securing web browsers and applications. These strategies protect an organization's digital assets, such as websites, mobile apps, payment systems, and more, from cyber threats. 

Most web application security threats occur due to  `existing vulnerabilities`. Cybercriminals use website vulnerability scanners to exploit application weaknesses and vulnerabilities  to steal customer data for personal gain. 

The most common targets of web application attacks are `content management systems, database administration tools, and SaaS applications`. 

These applications are valuable and a single attack can cause unprecedented damage such as: 

- **Loss of source code** increases the risk of data manipulation. The source code is often sold on the black market to buyers who want to create high value-added applications but with a lower budget. 
- The **loss of classified information** can create problems such as ransom  or identity theft. 

Failure to secure web applications can lead to problems with the efficient functioning of organizations. Without strong security measures, they are at  risk of being attacked by bad actors.

Besides financial and reputational damage, it can also lead to lawsuits and  compliance cost violations. 

It is also essential to get the latest web application security tools to stay safe from any security issues. 



Next, we look at why it's important to protect your web applications.

## Web Application Security - Growing Concern 

Most web application attacks are unpredictable. The COVID-19 outbreak is contributing significantly to the unprecedented increase in such attacks. The shutdown caused by the pandemic has prompted companies to adopt a telework framework that has gradually become the new normal. 

Web application vulnerabilities raise significant security concerns, which can escalate into a full-blown attack if ignored. a [cyberattack on T-Mobile](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-breach-exposed-ssn-dob-of-40m-people/) left millions of customers with a massive  data breach. Stolen data is  actively sold in the market. 

## Tips for preventing web application attacks


Here are some important tips that will prove effective in preventing cyberattacks: 

### Encrypt connections over Https 

Web server encryption is essential as businesses move towards digitization their process. This step doesn't even require high-level technical expertise or expensive web application security solutions. However, many organizations do not incorporate this into their privacy policies. 

Attackers often take advantage of `unencrypted Hypertext Transfer Protocol` (HTTP) requests and forge duplicate signatures to confuse  users. If not, make sure to start encrypting all connections between the user's web browser and your web server. 

These problems can be avoided with HTTPS encryption. HTTPS ensures data transmission between the user and the server,  `eliminating the most common  data breaches`. 

### WAF - Web Application Firewall 

WAFs are a combination of different hardware and software elements to effectively block security threats to web applications. It is used to protect web applications from malicious activities. WAF is one of the most sought after web application security solutions on the market today. 

A  web application with a firewall puts a `filtering barrier` between the targeted server and the attacker. The WAF signature pool also undergoes constant updates through which  tools and users identify bad actors. 

### Manual crawling 

One can perform complex web application security tests to learn more about minor vulnerabilities that a tool might overlook, leading to a breach.

### DDoS 

Mitigating DDoS attacks should be a priority for web application security as it ensures trust between the user and the server. 

## Benefits of Web Application Security

Web application security is important for five main reasons: 

### Correctness: 

A unique security mechanism that easily determines the authenticity of  data.  

### Authentication: 

It provides users with a unique identity that ensures the security of their data.  

### Authorization: 

Users are authorized to make changes to their data through valid credentials.  

### Confidentiality: 

It establishes trust between the user and the server by making data accessible only  to those who have  access.  

### Availability: 

Confirm the rapid exchange of information  between all parties on time, without delay.

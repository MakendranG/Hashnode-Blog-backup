[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source contributions from October 1st to October 31st. Released by DigitalOcean in collaboration with GitHub. In October, you were invited to contribute and make pull requests to your favorite GitHub repositories.

# Why you should register for Hacktoberfest?

You can learn a lot while solving problems. During Hacktoberfest, many communities hold events to contribute to open source and discuss how to get started. 

# My Low or non-code contributions
  

I was really excited about Hacktoberfest this year because it was my first year participating. Hacktoberfest 2022 gives me the opportunity to make some quality pull requests. Now, this doesn't mean you should only contribute during Hacktoberfest, you should contribute whenever you have the opportunity to do so.

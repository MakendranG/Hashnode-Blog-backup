## Why Software Testing is Important



## What is Software Testing?  


Testing anything means confirming that  the actual results match the expected results. The same principles apply in the case of software to ensure that the software system is perfect. Testing is a lengthy process and there are many different procedures to do it. These steps ensure that each  software  or system component meets the expected performance standard  set  by  industries or customers prior to bringing the product to market. These steps and processes also help  identify flaws, gaps or missing requirements that are contrary to  actual requirements. Testing is  done manually or using automated tools.  


## Benefits of Software Testing 

Testing is more than simply pressing buttons. Here we have discussed some benefits of the importance of including testing in the software development life cycle. 

Software testing is essential to ensure that your software is bug free and performing well. Here are the benefits of software testing: 

### Security 

- This is the most diplomatic and useful benefit of software testing. 
- Your audience will trust your products if they are safe and will offer to help them pay or use them safely by eliminating risk.

### Product quality

- Product quality  is the key to success. 
- This is an essential requirement of any software product, and software testing  makes it more reliable and error-free for your customers.

### Cost-effectiveness

- This is one of the essential advantages of software testing where companies can save unnecessary costs. 
- Quality assurance ensures that your product or service is tested after it has been developed, following all the steps necessary to correct the defects discovered in the previous step.

### Customer satisfaction

- Your software must provide security, which is a valuable part of customer satisfaction.
- Besides the quality of the software, the main goal of any product is to satisfy the customer. 
- Different types of software testing provide the best user experience.

## Why Software Testing is Important

### Cost Saving

1. Errors are a return cost issue for customers who have received complex schedules. 
2. Additional software costs can represent a significant loss to the business and can adversely affect pre-planned schedules and cost planning. 
3. Businesses face significant damage and unsatisfactory products. 
4. Software testing is part of the software development lifecycle, saving you these additional costs and keeping your software bug free. 
5. Quality assurance of software and products increases reliability and value. 
6. Minor errors also play an important role in conversion rates.
7. All organizations try to please their customers. If a product is not durable, additional investments are needed to fix it.
8. The sooner defects are detected, the less need for post-processing and the less expensive the implementation will be.

### Security

Software testing helps companies identify software bugs and vulnerabilities. Helps determine if product data is protected from potential intrusions. Furthermore, the tests ensure that the product system is free from threats and risks that could harm users.

The purpose of the safety test is to:

- Find the dangers very early in the system. 
- Enable developers to resolve security standards through encryption.
- Calculate possible system vulnerabilities. It helps you find all potential security vulnerabilities in your system.

### Quality of the Product

1. Product quality is a key factor as it reflects the success of an organization and helps build its reputation. Business goals for product success and invested accordingly to make profits from the product. 
2. When an organization makes quality products that continue to meet customer demands, it can lead to lower manufacturing costs, recurring customers, higher return on investment, and higher revenue.
3. QA ensures that the software is good and functioning properly by detecting bugs and errors that affect the quality of the software. 
4. As such, it helps ensure software usability and converts software applications into end products that work exactly as the designer intended.

### Customer satisfaction

1. The primary goal of any organization is to ensure that their products provide maximum satisfaction to their customers. 
2. The reason organizations should test their software is that it provides an optimal and required user experience. 
3. Organizations can therefore benefit frequently and for a long time from testing their software. Earning customer trust is not easy, and if a system fails or malfunctions, it can lead to loss of customers.

### Enhancing the Development Process

In product development, software needs to be improved and made more effective. These developments can cause new bugs in your system. Therefore, the software testing process helps to avoid  damage to the system. 

Improve software performance and configure your QA process with multiple tools such as JIRA, Mantis Hub, Azure DevOps, and  internal bug tracking tools. 

In addition, automated testing improves the QA process by more than 10 times. This can be done using Selenium  and Java, and frameworks such as Maven, TestNG, and Jenkins.  

### Easily add new features 

The older the code, the more complex  the product. Software testing avoids this complexity by allowing developers to safely add new features. 

It can be difficult for new developers to add or edit old code, but it can be avoided by using the broker feature. It helps make your software stand out in the market and win the competition. 

### Determining Software Performance 

Software  is not about the beauty of clean coding. Brilliant graphics and the look of the software, which are part of the software's user experience, are not so important, but how smoothly the software runs is  key to its success. 

Performance also defines a product's success rate. This is where  **performance testing** comes into play. Performance tests defined with specific performance matrices help meet these matrices and make the product sustainable under real-time user experience. 

As you can imagine, performance testing allows users to underestimate the effectiveness of a product.

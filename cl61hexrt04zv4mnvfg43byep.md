## DevOps solution on Azure


 Combine Azure DevOps with open source DevOps tools to fit your own workflow and integrate seamlessly with Azure. 

Whether your app uses virtual machines, web apps, or Kubernetes, implement DevOps practices such as CI / CD, infrastructure as code, and continuous monitoring with Azure and the DevOps toolchain of your choice. 

## CI / CD
 

1. From code to the cloud,  continuous integration and continuous delivery, and tool selection automate all parts of the DevOps process. 
2. Define a `CI / CD pipeline` and use the Azure pipeline to manage releases in multiple environments. 
3. Target all Azure services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure virtual machines, and Azure Functions. 
4. Use `GitHub actions` to automate your workflow. 
5. Host Jenkins workloads, extend existing configurations, and use Jenkins plugins for Azure to simplify CI / CD. 
6. Build a fast and repeatable deployment to Azure using `Spinnaker`.  


## Agile 

1. Apply agile software development methodologies using planning, tracking, and reporting to shorten release cycles and gain complete visibility into the software development process. 
2. Manage your projects on GitHub. 
3. You can also use Azure Boards to do the following: Define, assign, and track work items.  
4. Manage the backlog. 
5. Create a custom dashboard to track your progress.  
6. Get advanced analysis and reports. 

## Version control
 

1. Use GitHub to manage, share, and collaborate on Git repositories. Build a team's trusted code workflow with pull requests and code reviews. 
2. Troubleshooting. 
3. Continuous Integration Tools-Includes apps on the GitHub Marketplace.  

## Infrastructure as code 

1. Define cloud resources in a descriptive way so that your environment is versioned and committed to the repository along with your application code. 
2. By treating your infrastructure as code, you can provision cloud resources in a repeatable and reliable way to ensure that your cloud environment is fully managed. 
3. Use the Azure Blueprint to define a repeatable, fully managed environment. 
4. Use open source tools such as HashiCorp `Terraform and Ansible` that fully support  Azure resources. 
 

## Configuration management 

1. Manage system-wide resource configurations, apply desired states, deploy configuration updates, and automate  unexpected changes and problem resolution. 
2. Azure offers several DevOps tools for configuration management, including Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Azure Automation. 
 

## Monitoring 

1. Monitor the health of your infrastructure  and integrate Azure Monitor with existing dashboards in Grafana, Kibana, or the Azure portal. 
2. Practice monitoring the entire stack continuously. 
3. Configure actionable alerts for all Azure services.  
4. Collect, query, and analyze logs to gain insights and mitigate problems. 
5. Use container monitoring for AKS.

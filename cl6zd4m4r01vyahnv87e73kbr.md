I will focus on **cloud operations** and I am excited to expand the content of this page to cover more on this topic.

## What is the AWS Community Builders Program?

> *The AWS Community Builders program offers technical resources, education, and networking opportunities to AWS technical enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with the technical community.*

## My Focus Area

I've been focusing on supporting applications hosted on AWS for the past year or so, and that's where I've been on my cloud journey. I've written a few articles about some of the AWS components I've worked on, but I haven't really focused on them.

In email, I focus on the cloud operations category of the program, so I spend more time reading and creating content. My current role majorly focuses on automating the cloud operations, so I will be creating more content on this topic. 



## Conclusion

I am very excited to be a part of the AWS Community Builders program. I look forward to sharing more content and seeing how I can contribute.

I'm very curious about what you want to see about AWS related content. Please leave your comments on this article. All suggestions are welcome!

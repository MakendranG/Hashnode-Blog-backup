## Everything You Need to Know About Insights From the AZ-104 Bootcamp Session - Week 2

In this blog, I am sharing my learning that are gained from the Week-2 of AZ-104: Microsoft `Azure Administrator Bootcamp`.


This boot camp is really useful for those who want to pass the AZ-104 exam.  It was a great opportunity  to participate in the Microsoft Azure AZ-104 Bootcamp hosted by the `Azure Developer Community` in collaboration with `Whizlabs` and `Reskill`.


The Microsoft Azure AZ-104 certification is an administrator-level certification that measures our ability to perform the following technical tasks: 

- Manage Azure IDs and governance. 
- Implement and manage storage. 
- Deploy and manage Azure compute resources. 
- Configure and manage virtual networks. 
- Monitor and protect Azure resources.
